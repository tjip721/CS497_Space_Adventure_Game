INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPILE AND PLAY GAME
To compile the game unzip the files and perform a ‘make’ operation in linux. If needed, a make clean can precede this. After this, the game can be started by typing “./goAdventure”. From here the game will prompt the user to either load an old game or start a new one. In general this should be all the instructions needed for a new user to begin playing. The prompts should lead the user around in the game and the user can experiment with commands to explore the game. The help command is a good place to start. Below is a cheat sheet showing how to win the game.

Take the gas or doohickey when you start. Wearing your jacket and then your shoes in that order will prevent you from freezing and allow you to move around. From here you can launch to space. When you pick up the doohickey, screwdriver, and power crystal use them on your spaceship and it will be fixed and you can return to Earth to win the game. If it is dark where you are, use your flashlight. If you can’t breath you must eat a mushroom to not suffocate. 
Shown below is the cheat to each game. If you land on Mercury you will use the cheat for Game 1. If you land on Uranus you will use Game 2.
