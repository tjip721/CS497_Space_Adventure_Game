Welcome to the amazing space adventure game! In this game you have crash landed onto Mercury after exploring the Andromeda galaxy. You tried to take off again, but it looks like you have such low gas it would be impossible to make it back on the amount in the tank. Your goal is to retrieve enough gas to go back home. Explore the nearby planets, make friends with the locals, and rush home before you die of old age. When you get back to Earth you will earn the title "Supreme traveler." Good luck!
